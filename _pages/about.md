I am an undergraduate computer science student and research assistant focused on computer vision and machine learning, with a particular interest in 3D vision and its applications to garment-related domains such as digital fashion and virtual try-on. Through my research experiences, I have enjoyed working with real-world data, implementing and evaluating models, and collaborating with faculty and peers on long-term projects. I plan to apply to Ph.D. programs after completing my undergraduate studies to deepen my training in computer vision and 3D vision research. If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, feel free to contact me.
