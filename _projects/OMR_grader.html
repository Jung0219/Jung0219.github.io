  <h3><strong>OMR Sheet Grading System</strong></h3>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Developed a fully automated Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) grading system
    using
    <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong> to detect and score
    answer sheets from scanned images. The program applies advanced image
    preprocessing, perspective correction, and contour detection to accurately
    identify answer bubbles. It distinguishes filled vs. unfilled responses
    using pixel intensity thresholds and compares detected answers against a
    predefined answer key to compute scores automatically.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Implemented <strong>contour sorting and shape analysis</strong> to locate
      and label circular answer bubbles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Performed <strong>perspective transformation</strong> for alignment
      correction of scanned sheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Applied <strong>morphological operations</strong> for noise removal and
      hole filling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automatically graded 20-question multiple-choice sheets with
      <strong>100% accuracy</strong> under varied lighting and skew conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Visualized results by overlaying correct answers in green and incorrect
      ones in red, along with the total percentage score.
    </li>
  </ul>
